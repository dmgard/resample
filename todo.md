- DOING Over-under resampler
  - Extract consts/coefs into reusable, shared bundle, embedded in resampler
  - Keep count of deviation between approximate and ideal resampling
  - On phase-wrap, swap to alternate coef/const bundle 
- Multichannel
- SIMD
  - Fixed-register-length AVX/512 resampler kernels for all multiples of register counts
  - SSE+AVX/512 version of the scalar load-accum-store resampler for arbitrary filter lengths
    - Broadcast sample, multiply by coefs and do unaligned load, add, store
    - Pad filters to register length
    - Might even have enough time to calculate sinc coefficients online using approximations due to how memory-bound the operation would be
  - Can basically adapt current resampler by zero-padding coefficient phases by register len on either end and adjusting tapcount offset separately for loads
  - Eventually add SIMD coefficient generation
  - Need to consider extending length of output slice and copying+wrapping outIdx to avoid per-register index wrapping in assembly
    - Basically, pad output with enough room to always write partial accumulated samples past the midpoint. Once output is writing completely past the midpoint, copy midpoint:output+taps samples back to the start of output and wrap/update relevant indices
- API
  - Compute taps needed for desired -3db point, ripple, and rejection
- Tests
- Readme
  - Basically brings inner-outer convolution loop vectorization optimization to a multirate resampler
